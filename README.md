Algorithm of Routing for Post-Disaster Needs Assessment 


Java implementation of Tabu Search Algorithm for an academic research project supported by government and TUBITAK.


Initial routes are generated by 4 different heuristic algorithms:

- HeuristicMyopic1aAlgorithm.java
- HeuristicMyopic1bAlgorithm.java
- HeuristicMyopic1cAlgorithm.java
- HeuristicMyopic2Algorithm.java

Then the best inital result is taken to input improve algorithms.

The route is being improved by swamp and 2opt algorithms and after all of improvements finish, result route occurs.

- SwapAlgorithm.java
- TwoOptAlgorithm.java
